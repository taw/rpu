This directory contains a complete hardware emulator.

Conceptually it consists of two parts.
* The vm, which accepts low-level commands (load an object,
  shot a ray etc.). It corresponds more or less directly
  to the interface to the actual hardware.
* The "standard" driver, that sits between the compiler and the vm.
  It does things like parsing scene descriptions,
  support for testing, debugging etc.
  Alternative drivers do the vm tests.

dynArray.ml and dynArray.mli taken from extlib (with enum code removed)

=== Files ===
Makefile		- the Makefile
README			- quick overview

asm.ml			- assembler main
asm_ast.ml		- shader opcodes on asm ast level (TODO: partially merge with opcodes.ml)
asm_lexer.mll		- asm lexer
asm_parser.mly		- asm parser
build_kdtree.ml		- parse object description and build kdtree for it 
build_kdtree_obj.ml	- parse object description and build kdtree for it (accepts different input format)
import_obj.pl		- parser for OBJ format, its output is then fed to build_kdtree_obj.ml
decompile_kdtree.ml	- print out compiled kdtree for debugging
driver.ml		- common driver functions, used by test*.ml
dynArray.ml		- arrays of dynamic size
dynArray.mli		- arrays of dynamic size (interface)
hardware.ml		- object tree traversal
intersection_tests.ml	- intersection test algorithms (ray/bb and ray/triangle)
math3.ml		- 3-element vector mathematics
memory.ml		- memory interface
opcodes.ml		- shader opcodes
vm.ml			- virtual machine

test1.ml		- test 1 - trace + memory
test2.ml		- test 2 - vm
test3.ml		- test 3 - texture access
test4.ml		- test 4 - depth-shaded bunny (kdtree compiler, scene loading)
test5.ml		- test 5 - depth-shaded bunny (asm loading)
test6.ml		- test 6 - phong-shaded bunny (more asm)
test7.ml		- test 7 - TRACE shooting of primary rays
test8.ml		- test 8 - Edgar (mesh without any normal or texture info)
test9.ml		- test 9 - Edgar (mesh + interpolated normals, no texture info used)

depth.asm		- depth shader (primary rays shot by the driver)
phong.asm		- Phong shader (primary rays shot by the driver)
phong_trace.asm		- Phong shader (primary rays shot by the shader)
