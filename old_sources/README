Some notes on the structure of the code.

The code consists of 2 pieces.
* Assembler
* Raytracer

Assembler's main function is in rpuasm.ml
* load the asm source
* convert to token stream by lexer.mll (defined in parser.mly and ast.mli)
* parse into an syntax tree by parser.mly (defined in ast.mli)
* convert into a compiled shader by rpuasm.ml's convert_shader
* print in a Ocaml's standand marshaled data format
