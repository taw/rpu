Here's a very simple ABI for shaders.

Registers are R0..R15, S:
There is no stack, no memory, no A

At input, the register values are:
R0 - [u, v, hit_distance, 1]
R1 - ray_origin
R2 - ray_direction
R3 - hit_point (=R1+R2*R0.z)
R4 - triangle A
R5 - triangle B
R6 - triangle C
R7 - triangle color
R8 - light location
R9..R15 = [0,0,0,1]
S = [0,0,0,1]

At output:
R15 - color
